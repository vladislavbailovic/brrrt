Exploring RISCV instruction set for fun and profit
==================================================

This project is all about exploring RISCV instructions, binary math and virtual machine emulation.

All the main heavy lifting is done within the `core` module. There are some supplemental binaries, each of which implements a functionality built on top of core.

Well, yeah, no profit. This is just in title/description so that my loved ones don't stage an intervention for me.
